# Python Certificate App
This Python program allows users to select from a set of pre-defined templates and replace the variables in the template with values entered through a graphical user interface (GUI).

# Usage
To use this program, simply run the app.py file using Python. The GUI will appear, allowing the user to select a template and enter values for the variables in the template. Once the user has entered all the required values, they can click the "Gerar" button to create a new file with the template filled in with the user's values and even select if you want to send by email too.

The available templates can be modified or extended by adding new templates to the templates directory. Each template should be a plain text file with placeholders for the variables to be replaced. The placeholders should be in the form of ${variable_name}.
